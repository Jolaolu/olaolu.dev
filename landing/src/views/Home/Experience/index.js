              I've built products for companies and businesses around the globe
              ranging from basic websites to complex solutions and enterprise
              apps with focus on creating fast, elegant and accessible user
              experiences.

              Most recently, I was a Senior front end engineering contractor
              with Pixel2HTML building JavaScript applications and interfaces
              for orgs and individuals.
            </p>

            <p slot="text">
              Before then, I led the front end engineering team at Conectar LLC
              through building several React applications into a single powerful
              online learning platform. I deliver quality stuff contracting with
              these organizations internationally. I also created the Palenight
              theme for VS Code with hundreds of thousands of downloads.
