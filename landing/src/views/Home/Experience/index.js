              Most recently, I was a Senior front end engineering contractor
              with Pixel2HTML building JavaScript applications and interfaces
              for orgs and individuals.

              Before then, I led the front end engineering team at Conectar LLC
              through building multiple React applications into a single
              powerful online learning platform. I deliver quality stuff
              contracting with these organizations internationally. I also
              created the Palenight theme for VS Code which has seen hundreds of
              thousands of downloads.
