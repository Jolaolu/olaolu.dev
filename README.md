## Olaolu's website [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7392b4b2-2f2b-4948-b587-78f6e2f3b7b4/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/literal-sauce-drip/deploys)

This repo is home for the codebase of my site and shelf of articles.

## Project setup

- Run `yarn serve` for development: Simultaneously kicks off
  `vue-cli-service serve` for the homepage Vue app and `gridsome develop` for
  the shelf app.

- Run `yarn build` for production: Simultaneously runs `vue-cli-service build`
  for the homepage Vue app and `gridsome build` for the shelf app, and then
  merges the two `dist` directories into a root `dist`.
